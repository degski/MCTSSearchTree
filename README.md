# MCTSSearchTree

Another stab at the 'ideal' Monte Carlo Tree Search Search Tree, using flat intrusive linked-list-type structures. This tree can only grow and cannot be reverse-iterated, as rthis is not required functionality. Re-using already explored search space [in later moves] will use copy-traversal.
